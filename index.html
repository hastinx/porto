                        When you have some text, how can you choose a typeface? Many people—professional designers
                        included—go through an app’s
                        font menu until we find one we like. But the aim of this module is to show that there are many
                        considerations that can
                        improve our type choices. By setting some useful constraints to aid our type selection, we can
                        also
                        develop a critical
                        eye for analyzing type along the way.
